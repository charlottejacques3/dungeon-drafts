  - can move really fast and suddenly, dodges your bullets (have an ai)
  - throws bombs (base the bomb threshold on how many enemies you killed before, or maybe the hitpoints instead?)

QUESTIONS:
- does int round down? i think i may be getting more weapon dropped items than health packs but i'm not sure
- should i make xp, hpMax, speed, and damage carry over to the next level/try? maybe next level but not try? or just reset it to 0?

PROBLEMS:
- upgrade screen buttons/range enemies are not perfect
- damage shown on pause screen rounds down and when shooting it rounds up...
- fix darkness range, sometimes things act when i can't see them

CLEANUP:
- reset lives-- when hit by bullet + enemy
- clean up code (comments, printlns, darkness, enemy positions)
